# react-classcompont

class components are used before 16.8 version of react,but after functional componts with hooks are intrduced...
clas compnts extend React.component class which is having method--render,object--state,setstate,props,and some life cycle methods
the state object is initialized using a constructor and stores dynamic data ,,
so it varies with user interaction using setstate and usestate
props are properties they are unlike states...they are immutable and
used to pass data from parent to child
